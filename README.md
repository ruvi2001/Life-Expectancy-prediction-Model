Life Expectancy predicting system based on the country 

Collaborated on a group project to develop a life expectancy predicting system using Python. 
Conducted data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering to optimize model performance. Selected and evaluated the best predictive model, and implemented the application using Flask for the backend 
and Streamlit for the frontend, enabling an interactive user experience.
